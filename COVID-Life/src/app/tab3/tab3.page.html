        <h2> Limit Contact  : </h2>
        COVID-19 spreads between people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet) through respiratory droplets, created when someone talks, coughs or sneezes. Staying away from others helps stop the spread of COVID-19.

        The caregiver, when possible, should not be someone who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.

        <b>The person who is sick should isolate</b>



        <ul>
          <li> If possible, have the person who is sick use a separate bedroom and bathroom. If possible, have the person who is sick stay in their own “sick room” or area and away from others. Try to stay at least 6 feet away from the sick person.</li>
          <li> Shared space: If you have to share space, make sure the room has good air flow</li>
          <ul>
            <li> Open the window to increase air circulation. </li>
            <li> Improving ventilation helps remove respiratory droplets from the air. </li> 
          </ul> 
          <li> Avoid having visitors. Avoid having any unnecessary visitors, especially visits by people who are at higher risk for severe illness. </li>
          <li> <b> Caregivers should quarantine </b> </li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Eat in separate rooms or areas </h2>
        <ul>  
          <li> <b> Stay separated: </b> The person who is sick should eat (or be fed) in their room, if possible. </li>
          <li> <b> Wash dishes and utensils using gloves and hot water </b> Handle any dishes, cups/glasses, or silverware used by the person who is sick with gloves. Wash them with soap and hot water or in a dishwasher. </li>
          <li>Clean hands after taking off gloves or handling used items. </li>
        </ul>
      <h2> Avoid sharing personal items </h2>
      <ul>
        <li> <b>Do not share </b> Do not share dishes, cups/glasses, silverware, towels, bedding, or electronics (like a cell phone) with the person who is sick. </li>
        </ul>   
        <h2> When to wear a mask or gloves </h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Put on a mask and ask the sick person to put on a mask  before entering the room.</li>
          <li> Wear gloves when you touch or have contact with the sick person’s blood, stool, or body fluids, such as saliva, mucus, vomit, and urine. Throw out gloves into a lined trash can and wash your hands right away. </li>
          <ul>
            <li> Practice everyday preventive actions to keep from getting sick:  wash your hands often; avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth; and frequently clean and disinfect surfaces.</li>

          </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2> Bedroom and bathroom </h2>
        <ul> 
          <li> <b> If you are using a separate bedroom and bathroom: </b> Only clean the area around the person who is sick when needed, such as when the area is soiled. This will help limit your contact with the sick person. </li>
          <ul>
            <li>  If they feel up to it, the person who is sick can clean their own space. Give the person who is sick personal cleaning and disinfection supplies such as tissues, paper towels, cleaners, and products </li> 
          </ul>
          <li><b>  If sharing a bathroom: </b> The person who is sick should clean and then disinfect after each use. If this is not possible, wear a mask and wait as long as possible after the sick person has used the bathroom before coming in to clean and use the bathroom.</li>    
        </ul>
        <h1> Wash and dry laundry </h1>
        <ul>
          <li> Do not shake dirty laundry. </li>
          <li> Wear disposable gloves while handling dirty laundry. </li>
          <li> Dirty laundry from a person who is sick can be washed with other people’s items. </li>
          <li> Wash items according to the label instructions. Use the warmest water setting you can. </li>
          <li> Remove gloves, and wash hands right away </li>

        </ul>

        <h1> Track your own health </h1>
        <ul> 
          <li> Caregivers should stay home and monitor their health for COVID-19 symptoms while caring for the person who is sick. </li>
          <ul>
            <li> Symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath but other symptoms may be present as well. Trouble breathing is a more serious warning sign that you need medical attention. </li>
          </ul>
          <li> Caregivers should continue to stay home after care is complete. Caregivers can leave their home 14 days after their last close contact with the person who is sick (based on the time it takes to develop illness), or 14 days after the person who is sick meets the criteria to end home isolation. </li>
          <li> The best way to protect yourself and others is to stay home for 14 days if you think you’ve been exposed to someone who has COVID-19. Check your local health department’s website for information about options in your area to possibly shorten this quarantine period. </li>
          <li> <b> If you are having trouble breathing, call 911. </b> 
            <ul>
              <li> Call your doctor or emergency room and tell them your symptoms before going in. They will tell you what to do. </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Stay home except to get medical care </h2>
        <ul>
          <li> <b> Stay at Home </b> Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care. Do not leave your home, except to get medical care. Do not visit public areas. </li>
          <li> <b> Take Care of Yourself </b> Get rest and stay hydrated. Take over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen, to help you feel better. </li>
          <li> <b> Stay in touch with your doctor </b> Call before you get medical care. Be sure to get care if you have trouble breathing, or have any other emergency warning signs, or if you think it is an emergency. </li>
          <li> <b> Avoid Public Transportation  </b> ride-sharing, or taxis. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Separate yourself from other people</h2>
        <b> As much as possible, stay in a specific room </b> and away from other people and pets in your home. If possible, you should use a separate bathroom. If you need to be around other people or animals in or outside of the home, wear a mask.
        <b> Tell your close contacts </b> that they may have been exposed to COVID-19. An infected person can spread COVID-19 starting 48 hours (or 2 days) before the person has any symptoms or tests positive. By letting your close contacts know they may have been exposed to COVID-19, you are helping to protect everyone.
        
        <h2> Monitor Your simptomps</h2> 
        <ul>
          <li> <b> Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, or other symptoms.</b> </li>
          <li> <b> Follow care instructions from your healthcare provider and local health department. </b> Your local health authorities may give instructions on checking your symptoms and reporting information. </li>

          <li> <b> If you have a medical appointment that cannot be postponed, call your doctor’s office, </b>  and tell them you have or may have COVID-19. This will help the office protect themselves and other patients. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>  If you are sick, wear a mask over your nose and mouth</h2> 
        <ul>
          <li> <b> You should wear a mask over your nose and mouth </b> if you must be around other people or animals, including pets (even at home). </li>
          <li> You don’t need to wear the mask if you are alone. If you can’t put on a mask (because of trouble breathing, for example), cover your coughs and sneezes in some other way. Try to stay at least 6 feet away from other people. This will help protect the people around you. </li>
          <li> Masks should not be placed on young children under age 2 years, anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone who is not able to remove the mask without help.</li> 
        </ul>

        <h2> Cover your coughs and sneezes</h2>

          <li> <b> Use hand sanitizer </b> if soap and water are not available. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.</li>
          <li> <b>Soap and water</b> are the best option, especially if hands are visibly dirty.</li> 
          <li> <b>Avoid touching </b> your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands</li> 
        </ul>

        <h2> Avoid sharing personal household items</h2> 
        <ul>
          <li> <b> Do not share  </b> dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with other people in your home.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2> Clean all “high-touch” surfaces everyday </h2> 
        <ul>
          <li> <b> Clean and disinfect  </b> high-touch surfaces in your “sick room” and bathroom; wear disposable gloves. Let someone else clean and disinfect surfaces in common areas, but you should clean your bedroom and bathroom, if possible.</li>
          <li> <b> If a caregiver or other person needs to clean and disinfect </b> a sick person’s bedroom or bathroom, they should do so on an as-needed basis. The caregiver/other person should wear a mask and disposable gloves prior to cleaning. They should wait as long as possible after the person who is sick has used the bathroom before coming in to clean and use the bathroom.</li>
          <li> High-touch surfaces include phones, remote controls, counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables.</li>
          <li> <b>Clean and disinfect areas that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.</b> </li> 
          <li> <b> Use household cleaners and disinfectants. </b> Clean the area or item with soap and water or another detergent if it is dirty. Then, use a household disinfectant.</li> 
          <li> Be sure to follow the instructions on the label to ensure safe and effective use of the product.
